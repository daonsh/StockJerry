1. Personal Data We Collect
StockJerry collects data from you, through our interactions with you and through our Site.

The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the choices you make, including your privacy settings and the services and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.

You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. If you choose not to provide data required to provide you with a service or particular feature, you cannot use that service or feature. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.
